Results do not match other implementations

The following queries provide results that do not match those of other implementations of JSONPath
(compare https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/):

- [ ] `$[1:3]`
  Input:
  ```
  {":": 42, "more": "string", "a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}

  Expected output:
  ```
  []

  ```
  ["first", "second"]

  ```
  ["first", "second"]
  ```
  Error:
  ```

  ```

- [ ] `$[::]`
  Input:
  ```
  ["first", "second"]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["first", "second"]
  ```
  Error:
  ```
  Failed to parse SliceOperation: ::
  ```

- [ ] `$[0:3:2]`
  Input:
  ```
  ["first", "second", "third", "forth", "fifth"]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["first", "third"]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  ["first", "second", "third"]
  ```

- [ ] `$[0:4:2]`
  Input:
  ```
  ["first", "second", "third", "forth", "fifth"]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["first", "third"]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  ["first", "second", "third", "forth"]
  ```

- [ ] `$[::2]`
  Input:
  ```
  ["first", "second", "third", "forth", "fifth"]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["first", "third", "fifth"]
  ```
  Error:
  ```
  Failed to parse SliceOperation: ::2
  ```

- [ ] `$[',']`
  Input:
  ```
  {",": "value", "another": "entry"}
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  "value"
  ```
  Error:
  ```
  Found empty property at index 5
  ```

- [ ] `$`
  Input:
  ```

  ```
  true
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  1
  ```

- [ ] `$[0]['c','d']`
  Input:
  ```
  [{"c": "cc1", "d": "dd1", "e": "ee1"}, {"c": "cc2", "d": "dd2", "e": "ee2"}]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["cc1", "dd1"]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  {"c": "cc1", "d": "dd1"}
  ```

The following queries provide results that do not match those of other implementations of JSONPath
(compare https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/):

- [ ] `$[-1]`
  Input:
  ```
  ["first", "second", "third"]
  ```
  Expected output:

  ```

  ```

  Input:

  {"key": "value"}
  ```
  Expected output:

  ```
  Error:

  Parse error on line 1:

  Expecting 'STAR', 'IDENTIFIER', 'SCRIPT_EXPRESSION', 'INTEGER', 'END', got '['
  ```

- [ ] `$..*`
  Input:

  ```
  Expected output:

  ```
  Error:
